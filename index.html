    <h2>Hibernation is:</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>An inactive state resembling deep sleep in which certain animals living in cold climates pass the winter. In hibernation, the body temperature is lowered and breathing, and heart rates slow down. Hibernation protects the animal from cold and reduces the need for food during the season when food is scarce.
